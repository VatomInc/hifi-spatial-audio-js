## Super QuickStart - Web JavaScript
Here's a super basic version of how to use the High Fidelity Spatial Audio Client Library in the Web JavaScript context:

```JavaScript
<script src="https://hifi-spatial-audio-api.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/releases/latest/HighFidelityAudio-latest.js"></script>
<script>
    // Set up the initial data for our user.
    // They'll be standing at the origin, facing "forward".
    let initialHiFiAudioAPIData = new HighFidelityAudio.HiFiAudioAPIData({
        position: new HighFidelityAudio.Point3D({ "x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0 }),
        orientation: new HighFidelityAudio.OrientationQuat3D({ "w": 1, "x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0 })
    });

    // Set up our `HiFiCommunicator` object, supplying our media stream and initial user data.
    let hifiCommunicator = new HighFidelityAudio.HiFiCommunicator({
        initialHiFiAudioAPIData: initialHiFiAudioAPIData
    });
    // `audioMediaStream` is obtained from a separate `getUserMedia()` call.
    await hifiCommunicator.setInputAudioMediaStream(audioMediaStream);

    // Connect to the High Fidelity Audio Spatial API Server by supplying your own JWT here.
    // Follow this guide to get a JWT: https://www.highfidelity.com/api/guides/misc/getAJWT
    // If you don't need a guide, obtain JWT credentials after signing up for a developer account at https://account.highfidelity.com/dev/account
    const HIFI_AUDIO_JWT = "";
    try {
        await hifiCommunicator.connectToHiFiAudioAPIServer(HIFI_AUDIO_JWT);
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(`Error connecting to High Fidelity:\n${e}`);
        return;
    }
</script>
```
